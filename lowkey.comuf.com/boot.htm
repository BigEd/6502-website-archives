<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The bootstrap code is a minimal routine designed to establish some common
ground so that more substantial routines can be loaded in a common way.
It's short enough that the assembler syntax can be converted manually.
If nothing else, you can just use a DB assembler directive, or a monitor
utility to enter the object code directly.  The first 6 bytes and the stuff
after the RTS are relocation info which can be omitted.</p>
<h1>How to use it</h1>
<p>To use this routine, you only need 3 consectutive zero page locations
available.  Use the X register to indicate which zero page locations to use.
For example, to use $12, $13, and $14, enter with X = $12.  The bootstrap
code loads the routine at the address pointed to by 0,X (lo byte) and 1,X (hi
byte).  In fact, the bootstrap code only increments the low byte but not the
high byte, so setting the low byte to zero (i.e. loading at a page boundary)
is advised.  2,X is used only for temporary storage and does not need to be
initialized.  Note that the entry point is actually at the LDA #$40
instruction.  The "get" routine is the input routine, which should return a
character in the accumulator.  You can put a JMP at address 0 or you can
patch the address in the source code manually.<p>
<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>Characters below ASCII 33 are ignored, so the bootstrap code is somewhat
fault tolerant, as spaces are ignored and line ending differences (i.e. LF
vs. CR. vs. CRLF) are irrelevant.  A ! character (ASCII 33) indicates the
end of data.  A byte whose bits are %abcdefgh is represented as two
printable ASCII characters whose bits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>%0a1c1e0g XOR %00010100
<li>%0b1d1f0h XOR %01010000
</ul>
<p>This corresponds to the characters: (),-89&lt;=hilmxy|}</p>
